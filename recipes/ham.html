    <h1>Sweet Bourbon Ham</h1>
    <img src="../images/ham.jpeg" alt="ham">
    My dad made this ham for Christmas about 15 years ago, and we loved it.
    <p>
        I haven't made a different ham since and haven't loved one as much.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 1/2 pound) cooked bone-in ham (shank end)</li>
        <li>40 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup bourbon whiskey</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove skin and excess fat from ham, leaving a fat layer about 1/4-inch thick. Score ham in a diamond pattern with a sharp knife. Push cloves into the center of the scored diamond shapes. Place ham with cut side down into a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Bake ham in the preheated oven until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, not touching bone, reads 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, whiskey, and black pepper in a bowl until glaze is smooth.</li>
        <li>Raise oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Baste ham with 1/3 the whiskey glaze. Return to oven and bake until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), basting ham with whiskey glaze every 10 minutes. Cover ham loosely with a tent of aluminum foil if ham browns too quickly.</li>
        <li>Let ham rest for 15 minutes before carving.</li>
    </ol>
